# Garden-Project
Garden Project (Inspired by a coding challenge)

Start: 10/13/19

End: In Progress

Asks a user for a text file with the stated requirements:

	- First line is the size in format 'int,int' (i.e. 5,5)
	
	- Following lines are specific coordinates in the garden with a flower or wall with format 'char,int,int' (i.e. F,3,2)
      
The project aims to build a representation of a garden as a char array with the specifications of the text file input by the user with methods that can be used to manipulate the garden or gain info about the garden.
